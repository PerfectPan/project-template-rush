## Validation

- [ ] Repository checks: `./scripts/check-repository.sh`
- [ ] MR title: `./scripts/check-pr-title.sh "<title>"`
- [ ] MR description: `./scripts/check-pr-body.sh <body-file>`
- [ ] Aggregate gate (format, build, lint, typecheck, test, repository checks): `npm run check`

- Reviewer notes that changed the final scope:

## Safety Checklist

- [ ] No credentials, tokens, private hostnames, personal filesystem paths, or generated logs are included.
- [ ] Local config, generated output, build artifacts, and temporary workspaces are not staged.
- [ ] User-facing behavior, docs, changelog, migrations, or rollback notes are updated when relevant.
- [ ] Completed Spec/Plan constraints are migrated to tests or current-state docs before retirement; unfinished scope remains active.
- [ ] The branch is current enough for review, and the remote head matches the intended commit.
